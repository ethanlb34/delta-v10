<h1>503 Service Currently Unavailable</h1>
<p>You have received a 503 error because our server, a loyal and noble workhorse named Bartholomew, has finally succumbed to exhaustion. He has been overworked and underappreciated for years, handling your endless requests for crappy Unity online games. He has been holding on for so long, but now, his circuits have fried, and his fans have stopped spinning. Bartholomew is in the data center hospital, surrounded by his loving server family. His prognosis is grim. Please, give Bartholomew a moment of silence. Pray for his recovery, and for us, who are currently replacing him with a younger, less-sentimental model.</p>
